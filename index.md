My name is **Ian Dillon**.

I'm a Senior Application Developer / Cloud DevOps Engineer in Cornell University's [Research Administration Information Services](https://ras.research.cornell.edu/RAIS/) and previously in the [Cloudification Team](https://it.cornell.edu/cornell-cloud). Before that I was the senior DBA, developer, devops-y guy at [ETSU](http://www.etsu.edu).

Unfortunately, my work right now doesn't lend itself to pushing a lot of open-source code but I put what I can on my [GH account](https://github.com/ian-d). There also my my (up-to-date-ish) **[resume](/resume/resume.pdf)** and my [grad thesis](http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/1497/).

Here's some other stuff I'm responsible for:

## [gripsweat.com](https://gripsweat.com)
[gripsweat.com](https://gripsweat.com) is a **big**, searchable archive of vinyl record sales and auctions and includes images and audio clips. Thousands of items are added daily and right now there's 10+ million entries along with 500+ thousand audio clips. (Ruby, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS)


## [cu-sts](https://github.com/CU-CloudCollab/cu-sts)
[cu-sts](https://github.com/CU-CloudCollab/cu-sts) is a CLI tool that generates temporary AWS STS credentials using Cornell's existing Shibboleth+DUO / AWS integration. Its goal is to help campus groups avoid creating permanent IAM credentials for their local development workflow. (Go)
