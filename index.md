My name is **Ian Dillon**.

I am a senior DBA, developer, devops-y guy at [ETSU](http://www.etsu.edu).

Unfortunately, my work right now doesn't lend itself to pushing a lot of open-source code so there's not much on my [GH account](https://github.com/ian-d). There is my [grad thesis](http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/1497/) and my (up-to-date-ish) [resume](/resume/resume.pdf)...

Here's some other stuff I'm responsible for:

## BannerJobsub

The [banner_jobsub](https://github.com/ian-d/banner_jobsub) gem is a Ruby gem to replace Pro*C and reduce the pain of writing custom reports & jobs in the ellucian Banner ERP system. (Which is very painful, trust me.)

## gripsweat.com

[gripsweat.com](https://gripsweat.com) is a big, searchable archive of vinyl record sales and auctions and includes images and audio clips (when available). Thousands of items are added daily and right now there's 9+ million entries along with 450+ thousand audio clips. Currently working on a companion mobile app in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

It's especially fun/useful if you're into "deep" / big 45 based collector genres like [northern soul](https://gripsweat.com/search/?query=northern%20soul&page=1&sort_by=date&audio_only=1), [garage](https://gripsweat.com/search/?query=garage&button=), [KBD](https://gripsweat.com/search/?query=kbd&page=1&sort_by=date&audio_only=1), [afrobeat](https://gripsweat.com/search/?query=afrobeat&page=1&sort_by=date&audio_only=1), etc.
